  <h1>1. Cable Modeling</h1>
  <h3>1.1 Catenary</h3>
  <p>
    A catenary is a curve that can be used to model the position and tension of
    an overhead cable. It is defined by the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Horizontal tension (H)</li>
      <li>Unit weight (w)</li>
      <li>Horizontal spacing, from left end point to right end point (A)</li>
      <li>Vertical spacing, from left end point to right end point (B)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <br />

  <p>
    The catenary tension changes along the curve. The lowpoint has the lowest
    tension, and the tension increases moving toward either end. The horizontal
    tension (H) is the tension at the lowpoint, while the support tensions are
    at the catenary ends. The unit weight (w) is the weight per linear foot of
    the cable. Together, the horizontal tension and the unit weight define the
    shape of the curve (H/w). For a fixed spacing, a lower H/w will sag deeper
    than a catenary with a higher H/w, as shown below.

  <h3>1.2 Temperature / Tension</h3>
  <p>
    Most overhead cables respond to temperature change. As the temperature
    varies, the cable material will either contract or elongate. To account for
    this, installation tensions are typically provided for a wide range of
    temperatures.
  </p>
  <p>
    The temperature-tension points will be curve fitted to fill in the gaps for
    all temperatures within range. The curve needs to have a specific shape,
    as shown below. When temperature increases, the tension should drop quickly
    at first and then slowly taper off.

  <h3>1.3 Creep Correction</h3>
  <p>
    The creep correction is a cable tension correction that accounts for
    long-term permanent elongation of the cable. It adjusts the tension so that
    the cable is installed tighter than the cable-tension points discussed
    above. It is reported as a temperature, indicating that the cable should be
    installed at a set number of degrees colder than the actual cable
    temperature.

  <h3>1.4 Sag Correction</h3>
  <p>
    The sag correction is a cable tension correction that accounts for the cable
    hanging differently in travelers compared to when it is clipped in. This is
    caused by uneven spans and is most often seen in multi-span sag sections
    where the cable runs downhill into the largest or lowest span.
  </p>
  <p>
    The sag correction is added to the nominal sag of the catenary. Positive
    sag corrections will increase the sag (and decrease the tension), while
    negative sag corrections will have the opposite effect.
  </p>

  <h3>1.5 Scale Factor</h3>
  <p>
    The scaling factor is a cable tension correction that allows pre-stressing
    tensions to be calculated. This is factor usually is between 1.0 and 1.5,
    depending on how long the cable will be pre-stressed.
