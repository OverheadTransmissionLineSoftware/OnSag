  <h1>3. Dynamometer Sagging</h1>
  <h3>3.1 Overview</h3>
  <p>
    Overhead cables can be sagged using a dynamometer (tension gauge).
  </p>
  <p>
    The tension that the dynamometer measures is a catenary support tension, not
    the horizontal tension. The support tension can be considerably higher than
    the horizontal tension, and may vary by span end. To measure the correct
    support tension, the dynamometer must also be located adjacent to the sag
    span.
