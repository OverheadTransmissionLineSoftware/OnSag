  <h1>4. Stopwatch Sagging</h1>
  <h3>4.1 Overview</h3>
  <p>
    Overhead cables can be sagged using a stopwatch to time impulse waves.
  </p>
  <p>
    The traveling wave speed of a catenary varies with tension.

    where:
    <ul>
      <li>
        g = standard gravity constant
        (32.17 ft/s<sup>2</sup> or 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>)
      </li>
      <li>
        H/w = catenary horizontal tension / catenary unit weight
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    To time the traveling wave speed, an impulse is triggered at a span end. The
    wave will travel to the opposite end of the span and reflect back toward the
    original impulse point. The wave will continue reflecting at span ends until
    the wave energy is so small that it cannot be detected.

  where:
  <ul>
    <li>n = number of return waves</li>
    <li>L = catenary length</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Errors related to stopwatch starting/stopping can be reduced if a high
    return wave is selected for timing.
