  <h1>2. Transit Sagging</h1>
  <h3>2.1 Overview</h3>
  <p>
    Overhead cables can be sagged using a survey transit.
  </p>
  <p>
    The transit must be positioned under the cable and have a line of sight
    that intersects the catenary only once, as shown in the figure below.

  <p>
    Due to the way catenary equations are defined, there isn't a direct way to
    calculate the line of sight for a given transit position. Solving this
    requires a certain amount of guess and check. When the solution is found,
    two results will be provided:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Angle (&#952): the transit line of sight angle, from horizontal.
        Positive values indicate the angle is upward, while negative is
        downward.
      </li>
      <li>
        Target Position (t): the intersection of the transit line of sight and
        the opposite structure. The reported value is the vertical distance from
        the cable attachment to the center of the target.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>2.2 Control Factor</h3>
  <p>
    The control factor is the ratio of the sag at the survey point compared to
    the maximum sag of the span.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the surveyed point is at the maximum sag point, the control factor is
    equal to 1.0. As the surveyed point moves away from the maximum sag point,
    the value decreases. The control factor is important for transit sagging, as
    it indicates how sensitive the surveyed point is to changes in tension.
    Minimum control factor limits are established in the following figure so
    that the surveyed point has to be toward the middle of the span to be valid.
