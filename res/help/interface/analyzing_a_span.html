  <h1>Analyzing a Sag Span</h1>
  <h3>Activating a Sag Span</h3>
  <p>
    A sag span can be activated from the Edit Pane by double clicking the span,
    or by right clicking and selecting 'Activate'. The span is activated when
    the font turns bold.
  </p>
  <h3>The Analysis</h3>
  <p>
    Once a sag span is activated, it will trigger an analysis. The analysis will
    look at five (5) different cable temperatures. A solution entails:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Modeling a catenary based on the cable information and attachment
        positions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Solving for the selected sagging method.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The analysis usually finishes quickly on modern computer hardware. OnSag
    also speeds things along by using all of the available CPU cores.
  </p>
  <h3>Deactivating a Span</h3>
  <p>
    A sag span can be deactivated to clear the analysis results. Right click on
    the sag span, and select 'Deactivate'.
