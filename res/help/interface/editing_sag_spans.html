  <h1>Editing Sag Spans</h1>
  <p>
    Sag span data is stored in a document (.onsag) file. Editing starts in the
    Edit Pane. Sag spans can be added, removed, copied, modified, or moved
    within the list.
  </p>
  <p>
    To trigger an editing action, either:
    <ul>
      <li>Select a sag span and click a button in the edit pane.</li>
      <li>Right click on a sag span and select a menu entry.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Sag Span Editor</h3>
  <p>
    The sag span editor is launched when an individual sag span needs to be
    edited. There are multiple tabs for the data.
  </p>
  <h5>Cable</h5>
  <img src="sag_span_editor_dialog_cable.png" alt="" />
  <p>
    This tab shows all cable related information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Five (5) entries are provided for entering cable tension. All of the entries
    need to be filled. For cables that are sensitive to temperature, the
    horizontal tensions should decrease. For cables that maintain a constant
    tension for all temperatures, enter multiple temperatures but keep the same
    tension. Additional information is provided in the Calculations->Catenary
    help entry.
  </p>
  <p>
    The corrections allow the cable tension to be modified from the above
    entered values. Additional information is provided in the
    Calculations->Catenary help entry.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h5>Structures</h5>
  <img src="sag_span_editor_dialog_structures.png" alt="" />
  <p>
    This tab shows all structure related information.
  </p>
  <p>
    The structure and attachment are for documentation purposes, and don't
    affect the analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
    A single attachment position is modeled for the structure. The X entry is
    the horizontal position and Y entry is vertical position.
  </p>
  <h5>Sagging</h5>
  <img src="sag_span_editor_dialog_sagging.png" alt="" />
  <p>
    This tab shows all sagging method related information.
  </p>
  <p>
    A method is selected using the leftmost control. Once selected, options for
    the specific sag method are unlocked for editing.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Transit - Additional information is provided in the
        Calculations->Transit Sagging help entry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dynamometer - Additional information is provided in the
        Calculations->Dynamometer Sagging help entry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stopwatch - Additional information is provided in the
        Calculations->Stopwatch Sagging help entry.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The Temperature section is where the sagging temperatures are set. The base
    temperature is the expected/average temperature for the day, while the
    interval temperature sets the temperature range. A total of five (5) sagging
    temperatures are calculated:
    <ul>
      <li>Sagging Temp 1 = Base Temp - (2 x Interval Temp)</li>
      <li>Sagging Temp 2 = Base Temp - (1 x Interval Temp)</li>
      <li>Sagging Temp 3 = Base Temp</li>
      <li>Sagging Temp 4 = Base Temp + (1 x Interval Temp)</li>
      <li>Sagging Temp 5 = Base Temp + (2 x Interval Temp)</li>
    </ul>
   </p>
  <h5>Notes</h5>
  <img src="sag_span_editor_dialog_notes.png" alt="" />
  <p>
    This tab is used for adding notes for the sag span. Names of the
    sagger/checker, reference drawings, and assumptions could be useful to
    track.
