    Plots are set to auto-fit the window by default. The plots also support
    panning and zooming. Panning is triggered by left click and drag, while
    zoom is triggered with scrolling. As soon as panning and zooming actions are
    done, auto-fitting is turned off. To re-enable auto-fit, right click the
    plot and select 'Fit Plot'.
